# TradeBit Project Planning

This document outlines the overall architecture, design decisions, and implementation strategy for the TradeBit project.

## Project Overview

TradeBit is a Django-based personal stock portfolio management system with Zerodha integration. The project aims to provide users with a comprehensive tool for tracking, analyzing, and managing their stock investments.

## Development Phases

The project is divided into multiple phases to ensure systematic development and feature rollout:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

This phase focuses on establishing the core architecture and implementing essential features:

- Project structure setup
- Database schema implementation
- Core data models development
- Basic portfolio view
- Zerodha API integration
- Authentication system
- Docker configuration
- Documentation

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Planned)

- Advanced portfolio analytics
- Transaction history and logging
- Watchlist functionality
- Notifications system
- Enhanced Zerodha integration (real-time data)
- Mobile-responsive design improvements

### Phase 3: Optimization and Extension (Future)

- Performance optimizations
- Additional broker integrations
- Tax reporting features
- Predictive analytics
- Export/import functionality
- Mobile app development

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Architecture

The backend is structured as a Django project with multiple apps for modularity and separation of concerns:

1. **Core App**: Base models, utilities, and shared functionality
2. **Users App**: Authentication, user profiles, and settings
3. **Portfolio App**: Holdings management and portfolio analysis
4. **Zerodha App**: Integration with Zerodha Kite API

#### Key Components

- **REST API**: Django REST Framework for API development
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Zerodha Client**: Custom client for Zerodha Kite API integration

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and follows a component-based architecture:

1. **Core UI Components**: Reusable UI elements based on shadcn/ui
2. **Layout Components**: Page layout structures
3. **Feature Components**: Specialized components for specific features
4. **State Management**: Combination of React Query and Zustand

#### Key Components

- **React**: Component-based UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better development experience
- **React Query**: Data fetching and server state management
- **Zustand**: Lightweight client state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

### DevOps Architecture

- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration
- **Nginx**: Web server for production deployment
- **Let's Encrypt**: SSL certificate management

## Database Schema

The database schema is designed to support portfolio management with the following key models:

1. **User**: Extended Django user model with profile information
2. **UserSettings**: User preferences and API credentials
3. **Stock**: Stock information including symbol, name, sector, etc.
4. **StockAlias**: Alternative names/symbols for stocks
5. **Holding**: User's stock holdings with quantity, price, etc.
6. **Classification**: Custom classifications for holdings
7. **HoldingClass**: Many-to-many relationship between holdings and classifications

## API Design

The API follows RESTful principles with the following major endpoints:

1. **/api/v1/users/**: User management endpoints
2. **/api/v1/core/**: Core data management endpoints
3. **/api/v1/portfolio/**: Portfolio management endpoints
4. **/api/v1/zerodha/**: Zerodha integration endpoints

All endpoints use JWT authentication and follow consistent response formats. Detailed API documentation is available in the `docs/api.md` file.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: For models, serializers, and utilities
2. **API Tests**: For API endpoints and views
3. **Integration Tests**: For Zerodha API integration
4. **Frontend Tests**: For React components and hooks

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with token refresh
2. **API Key Security**: Secure storage of Zerodha API credentials
3. **CORS**: Proper CORS configuration for API access
4. **SSL**: SSL/TLS encryption for production deployment
5. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration via environment variables

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Development**: Local Docker Compose setup
2. **Production**: Docker Compose with Nginx and Let's Encrypt
3. **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling with multiple containers (future)

## Technical Debt and Future Improvements

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Increase test coverage across all components
2. **API Documentation**: Implement Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive documentation
3. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSockets for real-time data updates
4. **Performance Optimizations**: Database query optimizations and caching
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement continuous integration and deployment

## Risk Assessment

1. **Zerodha API Changes**: Risk of API changes breaking integration
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits required
3. **Scalability Concerns**: Performance optimization needed for large portfolios
4. **Dependency Management**: Regular updates of dependencies required

## Conclusion

This planning document provides a comprehensive overview of the TradeBit project architecture, design decisions, and implementation strategy. It serves as a guide for current development and future enhancements.
